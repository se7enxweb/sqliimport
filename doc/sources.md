# Sources

A source type reads records from a local file. Where the file comes from is the `origin` of the import's
`source_config`. The engine turns it into a local file once per run, so every chunk of the run reads the same data.

## Where the data comes from

| `origin` | Configuration | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `upload` | `file`: the stored name of an uploaded file | The upload (kept in the site's storage directory, `sqliimport/uploads/`) is copied into the run's directory |
| `url` | `url`: an `http` or `https` address | The address is downloaded into the run's directory, with the time limit `[ImportSettings] StreamTimeout` and the size limit `[SourceSettings] MaxSourceMegabytes` |
| `path` | `path`: a file on the server | The file is read in place, but only if it lies inside one of `[SourceSettings] AllowedPaths[]` |

Rules:

- **Addresses of private or reserved networks are refused** (intranet addresses, loopback, link-local), and so are
  host names that resolve to them. Set `[SourceSettings] AllowPrivateHosts=enabled` only if an import must read an
  intranet export. Only `http` and `https` are accepted.
- **A server path must lie inside an allowed directory.** `AllowedPaths[]` is empty by default, so no server file
  can be read until you list a directory. Relative paths are relative to the installation.
- A file read by `path` is not copied. Do not change it while a run is in progress.
- Snapshots and downloaded images are kept in the run's directory (`sqliimport/runs/<run id>/` in the site's
  storage directory) and are removed together with the run after `[RunSettings] KeepDays`.

## Common option

Every source type except RSS has the option `key`: the field that names a record (an ID column, a GUID). Without a
key, a record is named by its position (`#1`, `#2`, ...). The key is the record's reference in the run's rows and
log.

The key must be unique within the source. A run processes each reference once, so a second record with the same
key is not processed.

## CSV / TSV (`csv`)

File name extensions: `csv`, `tsv`, `txt`. The file is read as a stream, one record per line (a quoted field may
span lines). Each record is keyed by the header line.

| Option | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `delimiter` | `auto`, `,` (comma), `;` (semicolon), `tab`, or the pipe character | `auto` (detected from the first line) |
| `enclosure` | one character | `"` |
| `encoding` | `auto`, `UTF-8`, `WINDOWS-1252`, `ISO-8859-1`, `ISO-8859-15` | `auto` (UTF-8, else Windows-1252) |
| `header` | the first line names the columns | `true` |
| `key` | the key column | empty |

Empty or repeated column names are made unique (`col_3`). A byte order mark is removed. Without a header line, the
columns are named `0`, `1`, `2` and so on.

## XML (`xml`)

File name extension: `xml`. The file is read as a stream with XMLReader. External entities are never loaded.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `record_path` | Required. The element of one record: `book` or `catalog/book`. It matches the end of an element's path, so `book` finds every `book`. Namespaced elements are named with their prefix (`dc:creator`). |
| `xsd` | Optional. An XSD file the source must validate against |
| `key` | The key field |

An element becomes an array: attributes as `@name`, child elements by their name, repeated children as a list, and
the text of an element that also has attributes or children as `#text`. Example: in
`<book id="7"><title>Dune</title></book>` the paths are `@id` and `title`.

## RSS / Atom (`rss`)

File name extensions: `xml`, `rss`, `atom`. RSS 2.0 and Atom are detected from the file. Each item or entry is one
record with the same fields in both formats, so one mapping fits both:

| Field | From |
|---|---|
| `id` | `guid` (RSS) or `id` (Atom) |
| `title`, `link` | the title and the link |
| `summary` | `description` or `summary` |
| `content` | `content:encoded` or `content` |
| `date` | `pubDate`, `updated` or `published`, as given |
| `author` | the author |
| `categories` | a list |
| `enclosure` | the URL of the first enclosure or `media:content` (for the `image` transform) |
| `raw.*` | the raw element |

The only option is `key` (default `id`). This source replaces the RSS sample handler of 1.x
(`SQLIRSSImportHandler`), which stays for compatibility.

## JSON / NDJSON (`json`)

File name extensions: `json`, `ndjson`, `jsonl`.

| Option | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | `auto`, `json` (a list of objects), `ndjson` (one object per line) | `auto` |
| `record_path` | JSON only: the path of the list of records, such as `data.items`; empty: the top | empty |
| `key` | the key field | empty |

A JSON file is read whole. NDJSON is read as a stream, so deliver very large exports as NDJSON.

## Spreadsheets (`spreadsheet`)

File name extensions: `xlsx` (Excel) and `ods` (OpenDocument, as LibreOffice saves it). The format is detected from
the file. Both are ZIP files of XML, which the source reads as streams, without a spreadsheet library. It needs the
PHP extension `zip` (`ext-zip`); without it, reading the file fails with the message "reading spreadsheets needs
the PHP extension zip".

| Option | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `sheet` | The name of the sheet, or its number (`1` is the first) | `1` |
| `header` | The first row names the columns | `true` |
| `key` | The key column | empty |

One record per row of the chosen sheet, keyed by the header row. Rows with no value at all are left out, also before
the header row. Empty or repeated column names are made unique (`col_3`, `price_2`). Without a header row, the
columns are named `0`, `1`, `2` and so on. A sheet that does not exist makes the run fail; for an XLSX file the
message names the sheets the file has, and the preview of the editor lists them as well.

Values come as they are stored in the file:

- text as text, and the last computed value of a formula;
- numbers as stored, without the display format of the cell (`0.5`, not `50 %`);
- an **Excel date** is a number of days (`45231` is 1 November 2023; a fraction is the time of day). The transform
  `date(format=excel)` turns it into a timestamp ([mappings.md](mappings.md#transforms));
- an **ODS date** is its ISO value (`2023-11-01`), which `date` reads without a format.

A very large spreadsheet is read faster when it is saved as CSV.

## Adding a source type

A source type implements `expImportSourceInterface` (`identifier()`, `label()`, `schema()`, `extensions()`, a
constructor taking the validated configuration with `file`, `records( $cursor )`, `count()` and `sample( $limit )`).
`expImportAbstractSource` provides the `key` option and the record reference. Register it in `sqliimport.ini`:

```ini
[SourceSettings]
Sources[]=mysource

[Source_mysource]
Class=myImportSource
Status=enabled
```

`Status` is `enabled`, `example` (listed, but not offered for a new import) or `disabled`. A source can also be
a kernel service tagged `sqliimport.source`.
